The first and the major challenge was that the names of the countries changed over time. Some of the few examples that can be given are as follows:

1. North Korea and South Korea combinedly used to be United Korea
2. USSR broke up into many countries like Russia, Kazakhastan, Ukraine etc.
3. Many new countries formed in Africa and some are under conflict.

The data preprocessing and cleaning step was quite important and took the most time.

After the preprocessing was done, next target was to chose the datasets. I used two datasets namely CO2 and the sea level datasets. The libraries I used are pyplot, pycountries, dash.

The first plot is the increse of CO2 emmission by year. I have used a Blue colour scheme and the by adjusting the slider we can see the co2 pollution levels by different years.
The second and the third plots are the levels of CO2 in India and USA. Using these we can see that USA produced a much more larger amount of CO2 compared to India.

The third plot potrays the rising level of sea over the years which is a direct consequence of incresing CO2 levels and other GH gases. We have also provided the confidence intervals for each data point.

All the graphs and plots are interactive and took a lot of effort to build :)
